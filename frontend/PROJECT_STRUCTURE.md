# Flutter Project Structure

This document explains the typical folders and files generated by Flutter and their purpose in this repository.

- **lib/**: Main Dart source folder. Contains the app entrypoint (`main.dart`) and app code (screens, widgets, services, models).
  - `lib/main.dart` — application entrypoint.
  - `lib/screens/` — UI screens (e.g., `responsive_home.dart`).
  - `lib/widgets/` — reusable widgets (optional).

- **android/**: Native Android project files and Gradle build scripts. Key file: `android/app/build.gradle`.

- **ios/**: Native iOS project files for Xcode. Key file: `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.

- **web/**: Web entrypoint and assets when building for web (e.g., `index.html`).

- **macos/**, **linux/**, **windows/**: Platform-specific build folders generated by Flutter for desktop targets.

- **assets/**: (Developer-created) static assets like images and fonts. Register in `pubspec.yaml` under `flutter:` → `assets:`.

- **test/**: Unit and widget tests. Default file: `test/widget_test.dart`.

- **pubspec.yaml**: Central config — dependencies, assets, fonts, and package metadata.

- **build/**: Generated build outputs. Do not edit manually.

- **.dart_tool/** and **.idea/**: Tooling and IDE settings — generally ignored in Git.

- **.gitignore**: Lists files and folders Git should ignore (build outputs, IDE caches, etc.).

How this supports teamwork and scalability

- Clear separation (platform / app logic / assets / tests) helps multiple developers work in parallel.
- Keeping UI code in `lib/screens` and reusable components in `lib/widgets` makes the codebase maintainable.
- Registering assets in `pubspec.yaml` centralizes resource management and avoids runtime errors.

Suggested project organization (example)

```
lib/
├─ main.dart
├─ screens/
│  └─ responsive_home.dart
├─ widgets/
└─ services/
```

Reflection

- Knowing the purpose of each folder reduces onboarding time for new contributors.
- A predictable structure makes automated tooling (CI, tests, codegen) easier to configure.
